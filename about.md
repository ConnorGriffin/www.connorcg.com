I am a Senior Systems Administrator in Phoenix, AZ. My primary skills are Windows systems administration, network security, and cloud computing.

My hobbies include playing ice hockey, drumming, and automating everything in sight.

I aim to share as much of my knowledge as possible in hopes that I can help the next guy save some time.
