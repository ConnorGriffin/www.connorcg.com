Since our network is mostly Windows machines, most vulnerabilities were resolved via GPO. Many vulnerabilities for Linux systems, HP iLOs, etc. were resolved manually due to our small footprint. I'm sure the solutions could be mass-deployed if needed, but I don't have those solutions documented.

### Medium/Weak Ciphers & Protocols

#### Examples Vulnerabilities
* SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported
* SSL RC4 Cipher Suites Supported (Bar Mitzvah)
* SSL 64-bit Block Size Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)
* SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled
* SSL Weak Cipher Suites Supported
* SSL/TLS EXPORT_RSA <= 512-bit Cipher Suites Supported (FREAK)
* SSL/TLS EXPORT_DHE <= 512-bit Export Cipher Suites Supported (Logjam)
* SSL Null Cipher Suites Supported
* SSL Anonymous Cipher Suites Supported
*

#### Solution

We used a free application called [IISCrypto](https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto) to disable all of the cipher suites and protocols that were reported in Nessus/RiskSense as vulnerabilities.

For us, this looked like this:
